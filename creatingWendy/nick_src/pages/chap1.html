Chapter 1: Intro and Roadmap
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>
	Before we begin writing any code, we must first understand
	the process of writing a scripting language, and the process
	of writing an interpreter. What exactly does an interpreter do?
</p>
<p>
	An interpreter is a program that takes in a stream of code,
	written in a predefined syntax or grammar, and reads it, line
	by line, executing instructions, often in a virtual environment
	as it reads along. What sets it apart from a compiler? A compiler will go through the program, 
	read it line by line, then translate the code into another, lower
	level language, which is then run by the operating system.

<h1 id="tokenizing">Scanning and Tokenizing</h1>
<p>
	The interpreter goes through various steps in order to process a section 
	of code. It first must break down the string of code into 
	something it can easily recognize. This process is called
	<i>scanning</i>. The interpreter scans through the code and 
	creates a list of <i>tokens</i>. What does this look like?
</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how C-syntax code could be translated into a list
	of tokens.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">int i = 10;
run(i);</code></pre>

<pre><code class="nohighlight">0: INT -> "int"
1: IDENTIFIER -> "i"
2: EQUAL -> "="
3: NUMBER -> "10" 
4: SEMICOLON -> ";"
5: IDENTIFIER -> "run"
6: LEFT_PAREN -> "("
7: IDENTIFIER -> "i"
8: RIGHT_PAREN -> ")"
9: SEMICOLON -> ";"</code></pre>
<p>
	Now, when the interpreter processes the code, it doesn't have
	to hunt through each character to find out what you want to do,
	but rather can easily process a list of tokens based on a set 
	grammatical syntax, such as how you must have an <code>IDENTIFIER</code> after
	an <code>INT</code> in a definition.
</p>
<p>After scanning, the interpreter then does the actual interpreting of the code,
	which involves managing a virtual "memory" bank and simulating a call stack
	for function calls. This will be explored in more detail later.</p>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>
	To begin writing our language, we must first see how we want to structure
	our language. Once we know the syntax of our language, we can begin to creates
	a predefined set of tokens and instructions. The more comprehensively you plan ahead
	in terms of the language syntax, the easier it will be to implement later.
</p>
<p>
	After creating the syntax of the language, we can begin to write the scanner, 
	map out the memory management of the language itself, then the actual interpreter.

	In the next chapter, I explore options for storing data in WendyScript, 
	the syntax for WendyScript, as well as begin writing some code for structures
	that our interpreter needs to interpret the given code.
