<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre><code class="nolink">req <i>filename</i>;
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Wendy will look for the file in either the current folder of the file being executed
	or the wlib folder located in the installation of Wendy. (eg. if the wendy executable is built
	in the Wendy/bin/ folder, Wendy will look in the Wendy/wlib/ folder). </p>
<p>The found file's contents will simply be replaced in place of the <code>req</code> command 
and parsed as usual code.</p>
<pre><code>req "wmath.w";
// functions defined in wmath.w can now be used, eg:
factorial(5);</code></pre>
